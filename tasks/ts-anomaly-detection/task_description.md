# Unsupervised Time Series Anomaly Detection via Reconstruction

## Research Question
What modular reconstruction-based component (sequence representation, training objective, temporal dependency model, normalization, or robust training scheme) yields consistently better unsupervised anomaly detection across heterogeneous multivariate time series — server metrics, spacecraft telemetry, and satellite telemetry?

## Background
Reconstruction-based anomaly detection trains a model to reproduce normal input windows and flags points where the reconstruction error exceeds a threshold. The Time-Series-Library protocol (Wu et al., ICLR 2023) standardizes this setup: model outputs an MSE per timestep, the per-dataset `anomaly_ratio` percentile of train/test scores defines the threshold, and predictions are converted to point-wise binary labels for F1 / precision / recall scoring against ground-truth anomaly intervals.

## Objective
Implement the `Model` class in `models/Custom.py`. Given a window `x_enc` of shape `[batch, seq_len, enc_in]`, return a reconstruction of the same shape. The framework computes the score, threshold, and metrics.

## Model Interface
```python
class Model(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, configs):
        # configs.task_name == "anomaly_detection"
        # configs.seq_len, configs.enc_in, configs.c_out  (c_out == enc_in for reconstruction)
        ...

    def anomaly_detection(self, x_enc):
        # x_enc: [batch, seq_len, enc_in]  -> [batch, seq_len, c_out]
        ...

    def forward(self, x_enc, x_mark_enc, x_dec, x_mark_dec, mask=None):
        if self.task_name == 'anomaly_detection':
            return self.anomaly_detection(x_enc)
```
`x_mark_enc`, `x_dec`, `x_mark_dec` are unused for anomaly detection.

## Datasets and Fixed Protocol
- **PSM** — Pooled Server Metrics from eBay; 25 channels of IT-system signals. Released with Abdulaal et al., "Practical Approach to Asynchronous Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection and Localization", KDD 2021. Source: https://github.com/eBay/RANSynCoders.
- **MSL** — Mars Science Laboratory rover telemetry; 55 channels. Released with Hundman et al., "Detecting Spacecraft Anomalies Using LSTMs and Nonparametric Dynamic Thresholding", KDD 2018 (arXiv 1802.04431). Source: https://github.com/khundman/telemanom.
- **SMAP** — Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite telemetry; 25 channels. Same release as MSL.

All runs use `seq_len=100`, `anomaly_ratio=1` (percent of points predicted anomalous; the pipeline picks the threshold so that exactly this percentile is exceeded). Data is Z-score normalized per dataset.

## Metrics
F1 / precision / recall computed via the standard point-adjusted protocol used by Time-Series-Library — higher is better. F1 is the primary metric.
