# Adversarial Training for Model Robustness

## Research Question
How can we design better adversarial training methods to enhance model robustness against `L_inf` adversarial attacks?

## Background
Adversarial training is the most effective approach for improving neural-network robustness against adversarial examples. The standard method (Madry et al., 2018, arXiv:1706.06083) trains on PGD-generated adversarial examples using cross-entropy loss but suffers from a tradeoff between clean accuracy and robust accuracy. Advanced methods such as TRADES (Zhang et al., ICML 2019, arXiv:1901.08573) and MART (Wang et al., ICLR 2020, OpenReview rklOg6EFwS) address this through different loss formulations that decouple the robustness objective from clean classification. AWP (Wu, Xia, Wang, NeurIPS 2020, arXiv:2004.05884) further regularizes the flatness of the weight loss landscape and combines naturally with TRADES-style training.

## Task
Implement a novel adversarial training method in `bench/custom_adv_train.py` by modifying the `AdversarialTrainer` class. Your method should improve robust accuracy against white-box `L_inf` attacks while maintaining reasonable clean accuracy.

## Editable Interface
You must implement the `AdversarialTrainer` class with two methods:

```python
class AdversarialTrainer:
    def __init__(self, model, eps, alpha, attack_steps, num_classes, **kwargs):
        ...

    def train_step(self, images, labels, optimizer) -> dict:
        ...
```

`__init__`:
- `model`: the neural network to train (`nn.Module`).
- `eps`: `L_inf` perturbation budget (`0.3` for MNIST, `8/255` for CIFAR).
- `alpha`: step size for the inner PGD attack.
- `attack_steps`: number of PGD steps for adversarial example generation.
- `num_classes`: number of output classes (10 or 100).

`train_step`:
- `images`: clean images, shape `(N, C, H, W)`, values in `[0, 1]`.
- `labels`: ground-truth labels, shape `(N,)`.
- `optimizer`: SGD optimizer (`lr`, `momentum`, `weight_decay` already configured).
- Returns: dict with at least a `'loss'` key (float).

The training loop, learning-rate schedule (cosine annealing), model architecture, and data loading are handled externally. You only control the adversarial training procedure within each step.

## Evaluation
After training, models are evaluated on:
- **Clean accuracy**: accuracy on unperturbed test images.
- **Robust accuracy (FGSM)**: accuracy under one-step FGSM attack.
- **Robust accuracy (PGD-50)**: accuracy under a 50-step PGD attack — primary metric.

Scenarios (model + dataset):
- SmallCNN on MNIST (`eps = 0.3`)
- PreActResNet-18 on CIFAR-10 (`eps = 8/255`)
- VGG-11-BN on CIFAR-10 (`eps = 8/255`)
- PreActResNet-18 on CIFAR-100 (`eps = 8/255`)

Higher robust accuracy under PGD-50 across all scenarios is better.

## Baselines
The baselines below run inside the same harness via edit ops; defaults follow the corresponding papers:

- `pgdat`: PGD adversarial training (Madry et al., 2018, arXiv:1706.06083). Standard PGD inner attack, cross-entropy loss on adversarial examples.
- `trades`: TRADES (Zhang et al., ICML 2019, arXiv:1901.08573). Cross-entropy on clean inputs plus a KL-divergence robustness regularizer with default `beta = 6.0` from the paper. Reference code: https://github.com/yaodongyu/TRADES.
- `mart`: MART (Wang et al., ICLR 2020). Misclassification-aware regularization that focuses on hard examples; default loss weight `lambda = 5.0` from the paper. Reference code: https://github.com/YisenWang/MART.
- `awp`: AWP combined with TRADES (Wu, Xia, Wang, NeurIPS 2020, arXiv:2004.05884). Adversarial weight perturbation on top of TRADES with default weight-perturbation magnitude `gamma = 5e-3` from the paper. Reference code: https://github.com/csdongxian/AWP.
