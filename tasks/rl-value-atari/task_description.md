# Online RL: Value-Based Methods for Visual Control (Atari)

## Research Question
Design and implement a value-based RL algorithm for visual / Atari
environments using CNN feature extraction. Your code goes in
`custom_value_atari.py`. Several reference implementations are provided
as read-only `*.edit.py` baselines.

## Background
Atari games require learning from raw pixel observations (84x84
grayscale, 4 stacked frames). Value-based methods must learn an
effective visual representation alongside Q-value estimation, handle
high-dimensional observations, deal with sparse / delayed rewards, and
use experience replay efficiently. Different design points address
these via double targets, dueling decomposition, distributional value
functions, or quantile critics.

Reference baselines spanning the design space:
- **DQN** — Mnih et al., "Human-level control through deep
  reinforcement learning" (Nature 518, 2015). Convolutional Q-network
  trained with target network and uniform replay; the standard
  Nature-DQN encoder is the shared visual backbone.
- **Double DQN** — van Hasselt, Guez and Silver, "Deep Reinforcement
  Learning with Double Q-learning" (arXiv:1509.06461, AAAI 2016).
  Decouples action selection from action evaluation in the TD target.
- **Dueling DQN** — Wang et al., "Dueling Network Architectures for
  Deep Reinforcement Learning" (arXiv:1511.06581, ICML 2016). Splits
  the Q-function head into state value and action advantage streams.
- **C51** — Bellemare, Dabney and Munos, "A Distributional Perspective
  on Reinforcement Learning" (arXiv:1707.06887, ICML 2017). Categorical
  distributional value function with default 51 atoms over `[-10, 10]`.
- **QR-DQN** — Dabney et al., "Distributional Reinforcement Learning
  with Quantile Regression" (arXiv:1710.10044, AAAI 2018).
  Quantile-regression distributional critic with default 200 quantiles
  trained with the Huber quantile loss.

## Constraints
- Network architecture dimensions are FIXED and cannot be modified.
- Total parameter count is enforced at runtime; the contribution must
  be algorithmic (head design, target construction, TD loss,
  exploration, replay usage) rather than capacity.
- Do **not** simply copy a reference implementation with minor changes.

## Evaluation
Trained and evaluated on multiple Atari games including Breakout, Pong
and BeamRider within a fixed interaction budget using the benchmark
Atari wrappers. Metric: mean episodic return over evaluation episodes
(higher is better). Strong methods should improve across games rather
than tuning to a single title.
